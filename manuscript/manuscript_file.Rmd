### N~2~O undersaturation extent  
In this study we present the first national-scale survey of N~2~O concentrations and emissions from lakes, reservoirs, and ponds, hereafter referred to as waterbodies, in the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). A generalized random-tessellation survey design (Stevens and Olsen, 2004) was used to select a spatially-balanced and representative sample of `r dg %>% distinct(site.id) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% pull()` **[weird, I have 1090, but NLA17 report says 1,005?]** sites from CONUS waterbodies that are least 1 hectare in area, at least 1 meter deep, have at least 0.1 hectare of open water, and have a minimum residence time of one week (Figure 1). Sample sites were distributed across all nine major CONUS ecoregions and varied widely in water chemistry, morphometry, watershed land-use, and climate (See NLA website for all data?). `r undersatN2oPercent` percent of the sampled waterbodies were undersaturated in N~2~O and were therefore functioning as N~2~O sinks (Figure 1). We modeled the data using a bayesion hierchical approach and predicted the dissolved N~2~O concentration for all 224,916 CONUS waterbodies in the target population **[where did I get 224,916, Roy has 465,897]**. At the population level, `r propN2oSinkMean` percent (95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLower` - `r propN2oSinkUpper`) of CONUS waterbodies were functioning as N~2~O sinks. The Western Mountains ecoregion had the smallest proportion of waterbodies functioning as N~2~O sinks (mean = `r propN2oSinkMeanWM`%, 95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLowerWM` - `r propN2oSinkUpperWM`), the Northern Plains had the greatest (mean = `r propN2oSinkMeanNPL`%, 95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLowerNPL` - `r propN2oSinkUpperNPL`), and >65% of the waterbodies in every ecoregion were undersaturated (Table 1).

The extent of N~2~O undersaturation in CONUS waterbodies is surprisingly high, particularly for waterbodies in nitrogen rich ecoregions that are managed for agricultural production.  This finding  runs counter to the long standing paradigm that nitrogen rich surface waters are a source of N~2~O to the atmosphere (Mosier et al. 1998) and joins other recent reports that lentic waterbodies can function as an N~2~O sink.  Webb et al. (2019) found that 67% of sampled reservoirs in an agricultural region of Canada were undersaturated with N~2~O during the summer months and Soued et al (2015) report that 40% of rivers, lakes, and ponds sampled during the summer in a boreal region of Quebec, Canada were functioning as N~2~O sinks **[29% of lakes in Finland (kortelainen et al 2020)  but kortelainen and Soued are mostly pristine lakes]**.  While these latter surveys were conducted at regional scales, the national-scale results presented here provide the strongest evidence to date that most lentic waterbodies function as N~2~O sinks during the summer months.  This pattern holds across all 9 major ecoregions in the CONUS, despite the tremendous variation in climate, geology, waterbody morphology, and land use across the continental U.S..

### N~2~O saturation ratio
#### Distribution
Despite widespread N~2~O undersaturation in CONUS waterbodies, the mean N~2~O saturation ratio (ratio of measured to equilibrium concentration) was equal to or greater than 1 in seven of the nine ecoregions (Table 1, Figure 2), suggesting that, on average, waterbodies in these ecoregions were supersatured with N~2~O and therefore functioning as a source of N~2~O.  The apparent contradiction between widespread N~2~O undersaturation throughout the CONUS and average dissolved N~2~O concentrations that exceed equilibrium in most ecoregions can be attributed to the distribution of dissolved N~2~O concentrations across the population of CONUS waterbodies (Figure 2).  Across the CONUS, and within each of the nine major ecoregions, the distribution of N~2~O saturation ratios had median values that were less than 1, indicating undersaturation, but a long right tail composed of relatively rare waterbodies with levels of N~2~O supersaturation that are sufficiently high to drive the population mean to values close to, or even greater than 1.  Thus most waterbodies in the CONUS are functioning as N~2~O sinks, but a few function as strong N~2~O sources.

#### Controls on N~2~O
##### NO3
Dissolved N~2~O concentration increased with NO~3~ concentration **[need to pick a figure]**, likely because NO~3~ concentration partially controls denitrification, a type of anaerobic metabolism that couples the oxidation of organic matter with the  sequential reduction of NO~3~ to nitrite (NO~2~), nitric oxide (NO), N~2~O, and N~2~ (Knowles 1982; Richardson et al. 2009).  The reduction of NO~3~ to N~2~ can be incomplete, however, resulting in the release of N~2~O to the water column.  Incomplete denitrification often occurs when NO~3~ is relatively abundant (Beaulieu et al Harsha Lake, Beauliue et al USACE), likely because the final reduction of N~2~O to N~2~ is the least energetic reaction in the denitrification pathway, yielding less than 20% of the total energy yield of complete denitrification (Koike and Hattori, 1975;Richardson et al., 2009). When NO~3~ is limiting, however, denitrification can resort to scavenging N~2~O from the water column and reducing it to N~2~, thereby functioning as an N~2~O sink.

It is also possible that the correlation between N2O and NO3 reflects the simultaneous production of these solutes via nitrification.  Nitrification, an aerobic process which can produce N2O as a byproduct, is the microbial oxidation of ammonium (NH~4~^+^) to NO~3~ **[citation]**.  Nitrification might be expected to be more prevalent in the predominantly well oxygenated surface waters where the N~2~O samples were collected than denitrification, which is an anaeorbic process.  However, denitrification can occur in anoxic microsites within particulate matter suspended in an aerobic water column **[citation]** and can be transported from aoxic sediments to the water surface via advection and diffusion (Delsontro no longer a paradox).  Thus the N~2~O - NO3 relationship may be reflective of some combination of N2O production/consumption via denitrification and N2O production via nitrification.

##### Temperature
The sensitivity of N2O to NO3 increased with water temperature **[need to pick a figure]**, which is consistent with N2O production and consumption occurring through temperature sensitive biological processes.  At low NO3 concentrations, greater water temperature exacerbated N2O undersaturation, presumably by stimulating N2O consumption rates.  At high NO3 concentration, greater water temperature increased N2O supersaturation, likely by stimulating N2O production rates.  The relative effect of NO3 was greater than that of temperature, thus elevated water temperature serves to magnify the rates of N2O production or consumption dictated by NO3 availability.  

##### Waterbody size

While NO3 and water temperature were the primary drivers of N2O production or consumption rates, waterbody morphology determined the extent to which N2O processing affected dissolved N~2~O in surface waters.  When pooled across all ecoregions, the absolute magnitude of the difference between the measured and equilibrium N~2~O concentration, known as $\Delta$ N~2~O, decreases with increasing waterbody size class (Figure 3A). Waterbody size can affect dissolved gas concentration through several mechanisms. In lakes with low volume to benthic surface area ratios, the mass of N~2~O consumed or produced in the sediments can be a substantial fraction of the mass of N~2~O dissolved in the water column.  Since water volume to benthic surface area ratios tend to scale positively with lake surface area, benthic N~2~O biogeochemistry will have a greater affect on dissolved N~2~O concentration in small lakes, regardless of whether the sediments function as a net sink or source of N~2~O **[see Wetzel for references]**.  Furthermore, sediment may warm faster in small and shallow lakes, whereas thermal stratification may substantially delay sediment warming in large and deep lakes, resulting in greater rates of N~2~O production or consumption in small lakes **[need a citation for N2O ~ temperature relationship]**.  Thermal stratification may also prevent the exchange of water between the lake surface and the hypolimnion, thereby preventing N~2~O depleted or enriched water from advecting to the lake surface (Beaulieu et al N2O Harsha Lake and USACE N2O papers).

Persistent patterns in the air-water gas exchange rate across lake size classes may also contribute to greater N~2~O disequlibrim in smaller waterbodies.  Air-water gas exchange will vent excess N~2~O from surface waters or facilitate the invasion of air that can replenish depleted N~2~O in undersaturated waterbodies.  Regardless of whether a waterbody is superaturated or undersatured in N~2~O, air-water gas exchange will function to move the dissolved N~2~O concentration toward equilibrium.  One of the primary drivers of air-water gas exchange in lentic waters is wind speed (Vachon and Prairie reference).  Wind speeds tend to be greater in large lakes with long fetches and lower in small waterbodies, particularly if they are sheltered by shoreline vegetation.  Thus, greater air-water gas exchange rates in large lakes may maintain dissolved N~2~O concentrations close to equilibrium, whereas the affect of biogeochemistry on dissolved N~2~O is more pronounced in small waterbodies because low air-water gas exchange limits the rate at which excess N~2~O can be ventilated or depleted N~2~O can be replenished.

The influence of waterbody size is also evident in the statistical interaction between NO3 and surface area (Fig XX).  At high NO3 concentrations, N2O is highly supersatured in small waterbodies, but moves toward equilibrium in large waterbodies, as seen in the Coastal Plains ecoregion**[is CPL high NO3?]**.  At low NO3 concentrations, N2O is undersatured in small waterbodies, but increases toward equilibrium in larger waterbodies, as seen in the Northern Plains ecoregion **[is NPL low nitrate?]**(Fig).  

The model indicates that NO3, water temperature, and surface area interact to determine the N2O saturation ratio.  These interactions yield a broad range of N2O saturation values across the population of CONUS waterbodies, but also enable the identifcation of broad scale patterns.  First, small waterbodies with low NO3 concentration tend to be undersaturated, whereas small waterbodies with high NO3 tend to be highly supersaturated.  Large waterbodies, regardless of NO3 status, tend to have N2O saturation ratios close to equilibrium.  Therefore intra and inter regional patterns in N2O saturation are determined by the joint distributions of waterbody size, NO3 availability, and water temperature within an ecoregion.

**Not sure where I am going with this paragraph.  Maybe scratch it.  Mostly included as a placeholder for these references**
While previous surveys have documented relationships between lake size and dissolved methane concentration (Pighini et al. 2018, Juutinen et al 2009, Borges et al. 2011), another greenhouse gas, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document a relationship between lake size and $\Delta$ N~2~O.  Perhaps because previous surveys have included little variation in waterbody size (Webb et al. 2019, Kortelainen et al) or water quality (Soued et al. 2015).  


# EMISSION RATES
Despite widespread N2O undersaturation in CONUS waterbodies, the national average N2O emission rate was `r national_stats$post_med_en2o` (95% CI: `r national_stats$LCL_en2o` - `r national_stats$UCL_en2o` mg N2O m^-2^ d^-1^ and only the Northern Appalachians and Northern Plains ecoregions had mean emission rates less than 0 (Table 1).  This is accordance with the distribution on N2O saturation values where relatively rare, but highly supersatured, waterbodies pull the mean to a value that far exceeds the median.    ecoregional means range from `r ecoreg_stats %>% slice_min(n = 1, post_med_en2o) %>% select(post_med_en2o) %>% pull()` to `r ecoreg_stats %>% slice_max(n = 1, post_med_en2o) %>% select(post_med_en2o) %>% pull()` mg N2O m^-2^ d^-1^ (Table 1).  

emission rates seem way too low.  Need to double check k600 calculation
