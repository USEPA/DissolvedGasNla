# Introduction

# Results and Discussion

In this study we present the first national-scale survey of N~2~O concentrations and emissions from lakes, reservoirs, and ponds, hereafter referred to as waterbodies, in the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). A generalized random-tessellation survey design (Stevens and Olsen, 2004) was used to select a spatially-balanced and representative sample of `r dg %>% distinct(site.id) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% pull()` **[weird, I have 1090, but NLA17 report says 1,005?]** sites from CONUS waterbodies that are least 1 hectare in area, at least 1 meter deep, have at least 0.1 hectare of open water, and have a minimum residence time of one week (Figure 1). Sample sites were distributed across all nine major CONUS ecoregions and varied widely in water chemistry, morphometry, watershed land-use, and climate (See NLA website for all data?). `r undersatN2oPercent` percent of the sampled waterbodies were undersaturated in N2O and were therefore functioning as N~2~O sinks (Figure 1). We modeled the data using a bayesion hierchical approach and predicted the dissolved N~2~O concentration for all 224,916 CONUS waterbodies in the target population. At the population level, `r propN2oSinkMean` percent (95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLower` - `r propN2oSinkUpper`) of CONUS waterbodies were functioning as N~2~O sinks. The Western Mountains ecoregion had the smallest proportion of waterbodies functioning as N~2~O sinks (mean = `r propN2oSinkMeanWM`%, 95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLowerWM` - `r propN2oSinkUpperWM`) and the Northern Plains had the greatest (mean = `r propN2oSinkMeanNPL`%, 95% CI: `r propN2oSinkLowerNPL` - `r propN2oSinkUpperNPL`).
